## Why are 1 ohm resistors placed in series with the capacitor and inductor in this circuit when it is constructed?

## Explain why the oscilloscope probes alligator ground clips must all be at the same point in the circuit, and why the given location in the circuit was chosen?

## Explain why the 1 ohm resistance in series with the capacitor is wired up on the other side of the capacitor for the constructed circuit?

## Which channels were required to be inverted in order to display sensible / normal waveforms?

## Plot (using recorded oscilloscope data) or include image from oscilloscope showing inductor current and voltage, output voltage and capacitor current waveforms at the duty cycle you chose to initially  operate at (40%, 50% or 60%)

## Comment on the observed waveforms and on how they change when you vary duty cycle, describing your observations by considering theory of the circuit operation and taking particular care to note whether continuous conduction is always maintained

## Calculate the minimum switching frequency required to ensure continuous conduction is maintained when an output of about 4 V (20% duty cycle) is required. Compare with your observations.

## From your measured data, create a plot of dc output voltage versus duty cycle. Include on the same plot the theoretical curve for a Buck Converter. Discuss briefly.

## From your measurements of peak-to-peak output voltage at 20% duty cycle, calculate the % output voltage ripple and compare with theoretical calculations for your circuit if operated at the same duty    cycle.

## What did you observe when you altered your inductance value? How do the waveforms change? Comment on how it did or might impact the conditions for the boundary between continuous and discontinuous      conduction.

## Assuming you did not actually know the value of the inductor used in your Buck Converter circuit, devise a method for accurately calculating its value (for either single inductance case, or for two     placed either in series or parallel) from the observations and measurements. {Hint: consider the inductor current waveform carefully and take appropriate measurements}
